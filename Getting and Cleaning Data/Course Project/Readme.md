## Files
**CodeBook.md** a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data

**run_analysis.R** performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**FinalData.txt** is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
